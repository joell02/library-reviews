Library Reviews

Visit website at: https://library-reviews.herokuapp.com/

This website is a platform on which bookworms can find thousands of books they read and leave a review and a rating of the book or view reviews and ratings left by other readers. This application utilizes HTML and CSS for the front end and python(flask) and SQL for the back end development. It also utilizes the goodreads api to make requests to get data on book reviews and ratings and there is also api access that I created for this site.
